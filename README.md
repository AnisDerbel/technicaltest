### Problem faced

I have faced CORS problem while consuming the API and while playing the video. I could make it works only in Safari.<br>
PS: for the static API I have put the data in local json file and manipulate it from there.<br>
I have tested the video here https://video-dev.github.io/hls.js/demo/ and same problem, the video plays onky in Safari.I'm not sure whether I have a problem with my Chrome and Firefox.
